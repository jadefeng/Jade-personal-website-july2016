This is my personal website. 

It uses:
- one scroll
- device mock-ups
- images from Flickr
- AnimateSVGText

It is written with HTML/CSS and Javascript/jQuery.

TODOs:
- incorporating messaging with Mandrill / Mailchimp, rather than through mailto forms
- fixing up the "past experience" page carousel
- adding level of expertise to the coding langages
- making it responsive to mobile devices
